## Solving Sudoku Puzzles with AI

This project on Sudoku game finds how well different AI algorithms can solve any Sudoku puzzles.

We approached the problem with Backtracking. We also solved Sudoku with CSP which stands for constraint satisfaction Problem and CNN which stands for Convolution Neural Network. As the fourth approach, we used genetic algorithm.

We evaluated the results based on the time taken and memory used by each algorithm. Constraint satisfaction solved every given puzzle in milliseconds and turned out to be the fastest and most efficient method to solve Sudoku puzzles. The most memory-efficient approach, however, was the backtracking algorithm.
